# A Beverage to Drink

This exercise looks at **Classes, inheritance, polymorphism** and **overriding**.

Your friend Olwethu asks you to bring them something to drink. 
You’ll need to think about what **type of beverage** they want, and **how they drink it**. 


They might want a **hot beverage**, or a **cold beverage**. 
- If hot, do they prefer **tea** or **coffee**, and do they want **milk** and/or **sugar** added to it? 
- They will need to drink this **slowly**.
- If cold, you have **fruit juice** or a **fizzy-drink**. 
- They like to drink cold beverages **with ice**. 
- Fruit juice must be poured into a **cup**; fizzy-drinks they will drink **from the can**.

## Think about: 

### Naming: 
Why would we use the word “beverage” to describe the refreshment, rather than the word “drink”?

### Structure:
* What classes would you create?
  * What is the base class?
  * What are the subclasses?
* What are the methods; how are they are inherited?
* Where will you use method over-riding?

### Some of the methods to consider:
* `drink`
* `drinkSlowly`
* `drinkWithIce`

### Outputs:
When you have a beverage you can drink it. 
Depending on which beverage, you will get a different response back.

## Implement it:
### Develop the classes so that Olwethu can:
1. drink any beverage
2. drink coffee with milk
3. drink a fruit juice

### Overloading: 
4. Olwethu decides they want to drink a fizzy-drink *without* ice - how would you handle this?

### What other methods could you add for beverages?
Think of a method that could **apply for all different kinds** of beverages (Polymorphism)
* Implement this method for **one hot beverage** and **one cold beverage**

Think of a method that could **apply for only one** type of beverage
* Implement this method **for that beverage**
